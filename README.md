Welcome!

This is my third project.

TaskFlow is a to-do list website that has the following features:

(1) Has 3 columns: 1. Present task, 2. Currently doing task 3. Completed task

(2) Can be dragged and dropped

(3) Your tasks won't be restarted when you restart the website.

Some issues TaskFlow might have:

(1) Functionality across all devices

(2) User Interface Problems

(3) Unknown Bugs

Developing this website took many days, as when I started building it, I also went back and relearned JavaScript and CSS to understand the fundamentals better. Surely enough, I was able to breeze through it compared to my previous projects.

Overall, I think this is the most complex task I have ever done currently.

Frequently Asked Questions:

1. Did you use AI to build this?

- Yes, I did; about 40% of the code in here is written by AI, as I use it for debugging and small improvements.

2. Really?

- Yes
